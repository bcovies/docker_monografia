# NOTE: This file is read only by the traditional SysV init script, not systemd.

#
# To achieve the same result as the default 50-mysqld_safe.cnf, please create

# * Character sets

# * InnoDB
#

# Read the manual for more InnoDB related options. There are many!

#
# * Unix socket authentication plugin is built-in since 10.0.22-6
#
# Needed so the root database user can authenticate without a password but
# only when running as the unix root user.
#
# Also available for other users if required.
# See https://mariadb.com/kb/en/unix_socket-authentication-plugin/
